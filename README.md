-My project is a terminal game called Snake.

-The main role of the project is just having fun playing an old game that reminds you of your childhood.

-The main idea of the project depends on:
--Creating a Window which will represent the game's border, 
--then creating the character which will represent the snake, 
*Note*There will be 3 characters, one for the head and two for the body*
--then creating the character which will represent the snake's food, 
--then creating the key events which will control the snake's moves, 
--then creating the function that will append the same character as the snake's character and creating the counter variable that will be increased by one
--every time the first character of the snake which represents the head passes over the position of the the food's character, 
--then creating the function that will end the game if the snake's head passes over the border's position or one of it's body characters' postion
